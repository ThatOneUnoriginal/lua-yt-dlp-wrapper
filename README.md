# Dependencies  

## Lua  
This yt-dlp script is built with [Lua](https://www.lua.org/home.html), so you'll need Lua installed on your system. The script was developed using **Lua 5.4**, so it's recommended to use this version for compatibility. Older or newer versions may work, but proceed with caution. You can download Lua from the [official website](https://www.lua.org/download.html).  

## LuaRocks  
LuaRocks is required to install an essential library for the program. To get LuaRocks, follow the installation guide on the [LuaRocks GitHub repository](https://luarocks.github.io/luarocks/releases/).  

## LuaSocket  
LuaSocket is necessary for URL validationâ€”without it, the extraction process won't work. Since LuaSocket is installed via LuaRocks, you'll need LuaRocks set up first.  

Once LuaRocks is installed, you can install LuaSocket by running:  
```
luarocks install luasocket
```
